# 🧠 Team Noyce: 3-Minute Demo Script
## Alzheimer's Insights AI Prize 2025

### **Title**: A Comprehensive Conversational Dataset for Dementia Care
**Integrating Expert-Designed Personas, Clinical Scenarios, and Episodic Discourse Analysis**

---

## 🎯 **Demo Flow (3 minutes)**

### **[0:00-0:30] Problem Setup & Solution Overview**

**"Good afternoon, judges. I'm presenting Team Noyce's solution to a critical problem in dementia care.**

**The Challenge**: Currently, no comprehensive multimodal dataset exists for training AI systems to manage dementia-related agitation. Without authentic patient-caregiver interaction data, developing agentic AI for dementia care remains impossible.

**Our Solution**: We've created the first privacy-preserving, clinically validated conversational dataset using three innovative pillars:
1. **Expert-designed personas** reflecting diverse dementia presentations
2. **Clinically-validated scenarios** from real care situations  
3. **Episodic discourse analysis** modeling dementia-specific communication patterns

Let me demonstrate this with a live example."

### **[0:30-2:20] Live Demo - Ralph Hawaii Scenario**

**"This is Ralph - an 84-year-old former engineer with mild dementia who gets agitated when seeking help. Watch how our system generates therapeutic conversations that match clinical gold standards.**

**[Demo Actions]:**
1. Select "Ralph frustrated" audio sample
2. Click "Generate Voice Conversation"
3. Show real-time generation process:
   - Persona identification: Ralph (mild dementia, Hawaii memories)
   - 3 conversation samples generated with different approaches
   - Gold standard similarity scoring in real-time
   - Best sample selection (e.g., 85% match to clinical gold standard)

**"Notice the transformation: Ralph starts frustrated about the bell, but through therapeutic redirection to his Hawaii memories - grapes, surfing - he becomes engaged and calm. This isn't just text generation - listen to the voice."**

**[Play Audio]**: 
- **Ralph Frustrated**: "Hello? HELLO? This bell doesn't work! I need help here!"
- **Caregiver Response**: "I understand it feels urgent. Hey, I heard you grew grapes in Hawaii..."  
- **Ralph Engaged**: "Grapes? Oh right! Yes! Had to be creative with the volcanic soil..."

**"The AI captures not just what to say, but how to say it - with elderly speech patterns, emotional modulation, and natural pauses."**

### **[2:20-3:00] Impact & Vision**

**"This dataset enables breakthrough research for 55+ million dementia patients globally by:**

- **Training agentic AI** systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously in care settings
- **Reducing caregiver burden** through AI-powered therapeutic communication tools
- **Improving care quality** with personalized, evidence-based interventions

**Our three-pillar methodology creates the first clinically-grounded, linguistically-sophisticated training resource that will accelerate the development of empathetic AI systems capable of meaningful support for our most vulnerable populations.**

**The future of dementia care isn't replacing human caregivers - it's empowering them with AI that understands both the words and the heart behind every interaction.**

**Thank you."**
